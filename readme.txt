> I want to make a website in this directory similar to my chaotic-language 
website in the directory above, using hugo and Github file storage but with 
content from the Facebook page: 
https://www.facebook.com/jumpstartkidseducation 

----------------------
 Done! Your Hugo website is set up and running at http://localhost:1313/

  What I created:

  1. Hugo site structure - Initialized with proper directories
  2. Configuration (hugo.yaml) - Site title, description, menu, contact info
  3. Layouts:
    - baseof.html - Base template with header/footer
    - index.html - Homepage with banner, logo, services, and gallery
    - single.html - Template for individual pages
  4. Styling (static/css/style.css) - Purple gradient theme with responsive
  design
  5. Content:
    - Homepage showing banner, logo, description, services, and image gallery
    - About page with contact information
  6. Images organized in static/images/

  The site displays:
  - Banner at top
  - Logo and description
  - Services (Reading, Writing, Speaking, Listening)
  - Age range (3-13)
  - Gallery with your 3 JPG images
  - Contact info in footer

  The Hugo server is running - visit http://localhost:1313/ to see it!

> That's great. Can I uploade that to my Github, and serve it through my Vercel 
account.
